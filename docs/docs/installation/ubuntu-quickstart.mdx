## Quick Start installation

These **Quick Start** installation instructions are meant to install **erxes** quickly and with the least amount of effort.

## Fresh install of Ubuntu 18.04

You must have an account with your hosting provider prior to doing these steps.

:::note Are you using a fresh installation of Ubuntu 18.04?
These instructions assume you are installing **erxes** on a fresh **Ubuntu 18.04 instance**. If you are not using a new instance, then it is recommended you follow the [erxes step-by-step guide](/installation/ubuntu-step-by-step). This will allow you to execute only the steps needed for your specific server.
:::

The following installation steps work on any **Ubuntu 18.04** servers as hosted by companies like [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com), [Linode](https://linode.com) and [Vultr](https://vultr.com). The instructions do **not** work on **_Amazon EC2 instances_**.

## Server Configuration Options

Create an instance of a server running **Ubuntu 18.04**. (You should have the ability to to **SSH** into the server.)

You will need to point your domain or subdomain name to your new server. You can read a guide on how to configure your domain [here](ubuntu-quickstart#configure-your-dns-records-to-point-at-your-server).

There are two server configurations for installing **erxes**:

- **_Minimum_** - installs erxes with a **minimum server configuration**.
- **_Recommended_** - is the **recommended server configuration**.

You may test **erxes** using the **minimal server configuration**. But after testing, then follow the instructions to upgrade to the [recommended server configuration](/installation/upgrade-minimal-server). The **minimal server configuration** is not scalable and does not allow you to separate the services. Specifically, will not allow you to separate the MongoDB database, Elasticsearch and other services onto separate servers as the traffic increases.

### Minimum - minimal CPU and memory configuration

- Choose a server with the **minimum server** requirements:
  - **1 CPU**
  - **1GB RAM**

:::info
Due to the minimal server size in the **Minimum** installation option, we install Elasticsearch (for the search features in **erxes**) on a dediciated **erxes** Elasticsearch server. _What that means is parts of your data are stored on erxes servers._

This data is regularly purged and accessed by no other service or server for any reason, we are alerting you as some companies have prohibited rules regarding their data. In this case, using the **Recommended** installation below is the solution.
:::

### RECOMMENDED - recommended CPU and memory configuration

- Choose a server with the starting **Recommended server** requirements:
  - **4 CPUs or more**
  - **8GB RAM or more**

After setting up your server in either of the above configurations, continue with the instructions below.

## Installing erxes

### Log into server as root

Open the terminal or command prompt on your computer. You will need your **IP address**. (In this example, **44.123.32.12**). Type `yes`, when asked if you want to continue connecting.

```bash
# example ssh root@44.123.32.12
ssh root@your-ip-address
```

(**Note**: Some people get an error, **WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!**, please see the solution [here](/installation/ubuntu-troubleshooting).)

### Run the **Quickstart Script**

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erxes/erxes/develop/scripts/install/ubuntu18.sh)"
```

You will be asked to enter the domain name you would like to use. If you are using a subdomain, enter in the complete subdomain. For example, `erxes.example.com`.

See example below:

```bash
# Please enter a domain name you wish to use:
Please enter a domain name you wish to use: erxes.example.com
```

You will next be asked: **Would you like to install Elasticsearch on your server or use our free Elasticsearch service https://elasticsearch.erxes.io?**

You will have two options:

- **1 Install Elasticsearch** or
- **2 Use elasticsearch.erxes.io**.

:::note Read Carefully
If you are using a basic server (the above [minimum server requirements](ubuntu-quickstart#minimum---minimal-cpu-and-memory-configuration)), you must use Option **2 Use elasticsearch.erxes.io** which uses Elasticsearch hosted by **erxes** (free).
:::

Option 1 requires a server with 8GB RAM or higher and 4 CPUs.

**Note:** _By selecting the option to use the Elasticsearch hosted at erxes.io, you are allowing parts of your data to be stored on erxes servers._

Use the **Up Arrow &#8593;** and **Down Arrow &#8595;** keys to select the option and tab to select **ok** and continue.

- **1 Install Elasticsearch** or
- **2 Use elasticsearch.erxes.io**.

The installation process will takes a few minutes to complete. It will automatically install all the dependencies and make all configurations for the **erxes** installation.

If it completes with no errors, you have successfully installed **erxes**.

You have on last small step, set the password for the `erxes` user that was created during installation. In the future, you will administer your server using the `erxes` user.

Create a password for the `erxes` user:

```bash
passwd erxes
# Enter new UNIX password:
# Retype new UNIX password:
# passwd: password updated successfully
```

After setting up this password, you may continue.

## Congratulations, time to log in

You have installed **erxes**. You may now visit your url and complete the **Initial Configuration Steps**.
