## How to upgrade from Minimum Server

We recommend running **erxes** on a server with a minimum of **4 CPUs or more** and **8GB RAM or more**. However, low traffic installations are possible with the **Minimum Server** requirements of **1 CPU** and **1 GB RAM**.

Upgrading from the **Minimum Server** requirements to the **Recommended Server** requirements, will allow you to access additional features in **erxes** and avoid storing any data on the free **erxes** Elasticsearch servers. For example, **Dashboard Reports** are not available on a **Minimum Server** set-up.

Below are the instructions to upgrade from the **Minimum Server** to the **Recommended Server** requirements.

### Resize the server

The first step is to login to your hosting provider and resize your server. The server should be resized to the Recommended configuration of **4 CPUs or more** and **8GB RAM or more**. The server will shut-down and then restart.

### Edit the config.json file

There changes to be made to the `config.json` file to enable the full version of **erxes** on a **Recommended** server set-up.

1. Log in to your server as `erxes` user. Open the terminal or command prompt on your computer. You will need your **IP address**. (In this example, 44.123.32.12). You will be asked for the password your created at the end of [Quick Start](ubuntu-quickstart) instructions.

```bash
# example ssh erxes@44.123.32.12
ssh erxes@your-ip-address
# erxes@172.105.245.12's password:
# Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-118-generic x86_64)
```

2. You will now change three settings in the `config.json` file. The settings that need changing are `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`, `ELK_SYNCER`, and `USE_DASHBOARD`.

### Minimum Server configuration of `config.json`

```json
  "ELASTICSEARCH_URL": "https://elasticsearch.erxes.io",
  "ELK_SYNCER": false,
  "USE_DASHBOARD": false,
```

You will change the above settings to the following values:

### Recommended Server configuration of `config.json`

```json
  "ELASTICSEARCH_URL": "localhost:9200",
  "ELK_SYNCER": true,
  "USE_DASHBOARD": true,
```

The `config.json` file is located in the `/home/erxes/erxes.io/erxes/` directory. Navigate to this directory.

```bash
cd /home/erxes/erxes.io/erxes/
```

Next, use the **nano** editor to edit the `config.json` file. There are other variables in this `config.json` file, but you will only change `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`, `ELK_SYNCER`, and `USE_DASHBOARD` to match the values as shown below:

```bash
nano config.json
```

Your `config.json` should look something like this after you've changed it.

```json
{
  "JWT_TOKEN_SECRET": "0.88xxxxxxxxx115",
  "MONGO_URL": "mongodb://erxes:b8780b1@localhost/erxes?authSource=admin&replicaSet=rs0",

  "ELASTICSEARCH_URL": "localhost:9200",
  "ELK_SYNCER": true,
  "USE_DASHBOARD": true

  "DOMAIN": "https://example.com"
}
```

Save the file with `ctrl + x` and then `y to accept all changes.

Now simply run the `yarn restart` command in the `/erxes.io/erxes.io` directory.

```bash
yarn restart
```

If you received no errors, then you have successfully upgrade to the **Recommended** installation requirements.

### Congratulations

Your **erxes** installation will now run better and with all the features.
